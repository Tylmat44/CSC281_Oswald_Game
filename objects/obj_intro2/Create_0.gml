Saying my childhood was filled with hardship and uncertainty would be the understatement of the century. 
Born in the Big Easy, life didn’t start out as easy as the name may imply. My father died shortly before 
I was born, and Mom was left to take care of me and my two older brothers, Robert and John. Money was always 
a problem, so much that Mom was eventually forced to place all three of us in a children’s home because she 
couldn’t financially support a family. Memories from this time in my life are hard to find, mostly because life 
in the orphanage was so mundane and depressing. It wasn’t until I reached the age of 5 when Mom finally came back 
for us. She married an electrical engineer from Texas named Edwin and was finally able to support us again. For 
the first time, life seemed to be looking in a positive direction. [That wouldn’t last long.]

Mom and Edwin decided to move the family to Dallas. The transition was somewhat sudden and unexpected, but we
were all cautiously optimistic for what the future had in store for us. On the surface, there wasn’t 
anything special about Dallas that you couldn’t find in New Orleans, but it was clear that we all felt the 
difference leaving our old lives behind. After about a year, John and Robert were sent to a military academy 
while I started kindergarten. It was around this time when the relationship between Mom and Edwin started 
to break down. Again, our lives took a bleak turn for the worse. With Mom’s relationship in decline and 
nothing to distract me from the problems at home, my interest in school steadily declined as time went on. 
Mom stayed with Edwin for a few more years solely for financial purposes, and when I turned 8, they 
got divorced and so began the seemingly endless moving spree that lasted essentially the rest of my 
childhood.

I was starting to feel detached from other kids in my age group. School was more of a chore than anything 
else. Nothing about it interested me, I was always pegged as an underachiever, and it was hard to keep up 
with the material. So, I did what any 12 year old delinquent would do and skipped school. Of course, this 
didn’t sit well with Mom or the school officials, so I was placed in a youth house in New York. It had an 
almost frightening resemblance to the orphanage back in New Orleans, only adding to the stress of the 
current situation. During our time in New York, Mom and I stayed with John and his girlfriend in his 
apartment. I wasn’t thrilled about being in New York in the first place, but being around my older brother 
again brought me some peace of mind. But, as fate would have it, that glimpse of hope also seemed to 
fade just as quickly as it came. 

Roughly two weeks after arriving in New York, I had a terrible day at the youth house and simply wanted 
to be left alone. The incident began after we arrived at the apartment when Mom started asking about myday.
